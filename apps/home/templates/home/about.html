Footbag freestyle is a technically challenging sport.
Being able to find quality information when you need it is therefore
very important.
By having a comprehensive collection of move demonstration videos and tutorials
along with trick tips we are aiming to reduce the learning curve as much as possible.
<br />
<br />
Until now if you didn't know the names of various moves it was hard to find
any information. With the development of the footbag DB you have better ways
to find relevant footbag information.
This project extends beyond just organizing pre-existing information.
By leveraging the information there is the potential to do new things to help
people learn more about the spot.
